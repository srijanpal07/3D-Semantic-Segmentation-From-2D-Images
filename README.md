### Introduction
In this project, we conducted a 3D reconstruction of an environment while preserving the semantic information. We constructed a pipeline from 2D semantic labels and 3D reconstructed points to estimate 3D semantic reconstruction. Our methodology involves the generation of 3D sparse and dense point clouds using COLMAP, extraction of the segmentation masks using U-Net from the images provided, and finally employing a voting mechanism paired with a k-means algorithm to perform 3d semantic reconstruction.
